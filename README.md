# IoTKube

### Vision

Kubernetes made for real-time IoT and data pipelines, with built-in self-healing and observability.

### Motivation

- Standard K8s is not IoT/edge friendly out of the box.
- Multi-cloud/edge onboarding, self-healing, and observability are still hard.
- Data pipelines require lots of manual work.

### Key Features

- Out-of-the-box IoT/edge/data pipeline stack
- Self-healing via custom controllers
- Automated cluster bootstrap
- Advanced observability
- Opinionated best practices
- Easy multi-cluster/edge/hub management
